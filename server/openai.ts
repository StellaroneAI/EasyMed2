Guidelines:
- List 3-5 most likely conditions based on symptoms
- Assign realistic probability scores (sum should be â‰¤ 1.0)
- Severity: Low (minor issues), Medium (needs attention), High (serious concern)
- Urgency: Non-urgent (routine care), Soon (within days), Urgent (immediate attention)
- Confidence should reflect certainty of analysis
- Actions should be practical medical recommendations
- Always include appropriate medical disclaimer`;
